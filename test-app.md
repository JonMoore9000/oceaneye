**Complete OceanFeed Object Created** âœ…
- Added to `app/data/oceanFeeds.ts`
- Marked as "processed" in `app/data/liveFeedLinks.ts`
- Ready to use in the application

## âœ… FIXED: Modal Click Issue

**Problem**: Clicking on markers did nothing
**Solution**:
1. Replaced complex Headless UI modal with simple custom modal
2. Fixed click event handling with proper event prevention
3. Added debugging and removed Headless UI dependencies
4. Simplified modal structure for better reliability

## Fixed Issues in Globe Component

1. **Replaced complex deck.gl implementation** with a simpler, more reliable SVG-based world map
2. **Added proper continent shapes** for North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia
3. **Improved marker positioning** with better coordinate projection and clamping
4. **Enhanced marker design** with:
   - Larger, more visible markers (6x6 instead of 4x4)
   - Gradient backgrounds and multiple animation layers
   - Better hover effects with detailed tooltips
   - Pulsing and ping animations

5. **Added geographic features**:
   - Continent labels
   - Latitude/longitude grid lines
   - Better visual hierarchy

6. **Improved user experience**:
   - Centered instructions at bottom
   - Better tooltips with feed information
   - Smooth transitions and hover states

## To Test the Application:

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click "Explore the Globe" to go to `/explore`
4. You should see:
   - A world map with green continent shapes
   - Glowing cyan markers at ocean feed locations
   - Hover over markers to see tooltips
   - Click markers to open feed modals
   - Click "Learn" to toggle educational panel

## Expected Behavior:

- **Home page**: Hero section with featured feed preview
- **Explore page**: Interactive world map with clickable ocean feed markers
- **Feed modals**: Full-screen video player with educational content
- **Educational panel**: Tabbed interface with ocean zones and conservation info

## Ocean Feed Locations:

1. Nautilus - Gulf of Mexico (27.5Â°N, 90.2Â°W)
2. Monterey Bay Otter Cam (36.621Â°N, 121.904Â°W)
3. Hawaiian Coral Reef (21.31Â°N, 157.86Â°W)
4. Arctic Seal Cam (74.5Â°N, 95Â°W)
5. California Kelp Forest (34.42Â°N, 119.7Â°W)
6. Hydrothermal Vent Field (21Â°N, 109Â°W)

All markers should be positioned approximately correctly on their respective continents/ocean regions.
